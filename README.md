## Features

Features keyboard navigation (arrow keys + enter) and shows up to 20 results with preferred name, room assignment, and entry ID. Powered by the local resident database for lightning-fast searches.

### üìñ Bookmarks
Save and organize frequently visited pages with drag-and-drop management. Easily access your most-used StarRez pages.

### üéØ Auto-Select
Bulk select entries by pasting a list of IDs. Particularly useful on the Main ‚Üí Entries page for batch operations.

### üìã Clipboard Copy
Copy record IDs from dashboard sections to clipboard for easy export and external processing.

### üîç Dropdown Search
Add search functionality to the Dashboard dropdown menu for quick navigation.

### üë§ Initials Expander
Expands initials in shift and incident reports for easier reading and identification.

### üì± Phone Formatter

Automatically converts "incident ######" or "report ######" text into clickable links for quick navigation.

## Background Services

StarWrench includes always-on background services that power other features:

### üóÑÔ∏è Resident Database
Automatically builds and maintains a searchable local database of residents from the directory page. Only stores residents with status "Reserved" or "In Room".
